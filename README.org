* ohsh2notebook

Proof of concept to convert [[https://ohsh][ohsh]] sessions to jupyter notebooks.

** Instructions

```sh
go build .
./ohsh2notebook < ohsh-example.json > ohsh-example.ipynb
```

** Demo

View the [[./ohsh-example.ipynb][example notebook]]

** Jupyerlab requirements

This requires the bash kernel.

```sh
pip install jupyterlab
pip install bash_kernel
```

** TODO bugs

Poor translation of control sequences. Ideally rich terminal features
like sixel images and links would work in notebook.
